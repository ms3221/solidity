**A library for secure smart contract development.** Build on a solid foundation of community-vetted code.
It is a fork of openzepplin contracts. In addition to that, this repository contains Klaytn's token standards such as KIP-7, KIP-17, and KIP-37 compatible with ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155 respectively.

Please refer to [this](https://kips.klaytn.com/token) link for the mapping of Ethereum to Klaytn token standards.

## Overview

### Installation

```console
$ npm install @klaytn/contracts
```

An alternative to npm is to use the GitHub repository `klaytn/klaytn-contracts` to retrieve the contracts. When doing this, make sure to specify the tag for a release such as `v1.0.0`, instead of using the `master` branch.

### Usage

Once installed, you can use the contracts in the library by importing them:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@klaytn/contracts/KIP/token/KIP17/KIP17.sol";

contract MyCollectible is KIP17 {
    constructor() KIP17("MyCollectible", "MCO") {
    }
}
```

To keep your system secure, you should **always** use the installed code as-is, and neither copy-paste it from online sources, nor modify it yourself. The library is designed so that only the contracts and functions you use are deployed, so you don't need to worry about it needlessly increasing gas costs.
